-Welcome to this Project.
Its a project using APIs call to request data from a server, conserning books informations,
Then we save the data in the database, through the call of function theappicall(), 
which is called only once. After we display the data from the database in the about.ejs, 
and we can add a new book title, or we can modify one.

-To run you have to run some lines:

npm init
npm i ejs
npm i express
npm i body-parser
npm i pg
npm i axios

go to package.json and add   "type": "module"  so we can easily access the packages

to run you have to create your own databasae with the aprpopriate columns
and insert your db information at the start

to run :
node index.js (or nodemon index.js if you have installed it)

Have Fun!
